For Task 1, we had to identify events. I plotted the time series for every station on one graph to visualize the data.
I selected one station to analyze, because it appeared that all the stations experienced the same dramatic event.
I graphed the time series, calculated the mean, and a range of three sigmas plus or minus the mean.  
I plotted those thresholds onto the graph to identify events that surpassed them.

For Task 2, we had to determine stationarity for card types over the time series.  I plotted the time series for each card types,
and use the AD Fuller test to determine stationarity.

For Task 3, we had to determine the periodicity of the time series.  I used the Real Fourtier Transform, and plotted a power
spectrum for all the potential periods over the sample selection.  I then identified the stations that had the greatest power
at a period of 52 weeks, and determined the dates that those repeating trends occurred.

I worked alone for this assignment, but I shared my work for Task 1 with a classmate, Tyler W.
