### Assignment 1
For this assignment we were tasked with determining whether or not the ages of citibike users were drawn from specific distributions.  
I worked with Jon Toy, Adiran Dahlin, Christian Rosado, and Dana Karwas. Although we worked collaboratively, Jon for the most part led the 
work of the group.
We used two tests: the KS test and the AD test.  For the KS test, we tested the age distribution against normal and chi-squared distributions.
Both results rejected the null hypothesis, that the ages were drawn from the normal and chi-squared distributions.
For the AD test, we compared the age distribution to normal and logistic distributions.  Both produced results that rejected the null.
Therefore, the ages were not likely drawn from normal, logistic, or chi-squared distributions.

### Assignment 2
For this assignment we were tasked with plotting income data by gender to determine a model that could predict a woman's salary given a male's salary.
I worked with Jon Toy, Adiran Dahlin, Christian Rosado, and Dana Karwas. Although we worked collaboratively, Jon for the most part led the 
work of the group.


## Assignment 3:
**Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:**

Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

**Null Hypothesis: The average amount of weight lost by individuals on a diet (test) is less than or the same amount of weight as individuals who exercise (control).
$N_0 = P_test - P_control <= 0$**

Do American trust the president?
POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

**Null Hypothesis: The percent of Americans polled who trust the president is less than 50%.
$H_0 = P_polled < 50%**


Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

**Null Hypothesis: The cessation rates of smokers using the nicotine patch is less than or equal to the cessation rates of smokers using a placebo patch.
$H_0 = P_test - P_placebo <= o$**

Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

**Null Hypothesis: The mean IQs of children of women who smoked during pregnancy at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years is higher than or the same as the \
mean IQ of children of women who did not smoke during pregnancy. 
$H_0 = P_smoke - P_control >= 0$**
