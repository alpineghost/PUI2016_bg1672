  3. For Part 3, our group had to reproduce the results found in a study that examined the effects of a employmnet program on recently incarcerated men: http://www.mdrc.org/sites/default/files/What%20Strategies%20Work%20for%20the%20Hard%20FR.pdf 

We first followed the recreation of the results of their first test, which examined the percent of former convicts who were employed in a time period of three years after their release from incarceration. This was compared for a group that had participated in an employment program designed for former convicts and a control group that did not participate in that program.  The z statistic was used to find a statistical significance between the groups.

On our own, we used the chi-squared test to recreate the results of their second test, which compared the recidivism of individuals in each of the origional groups: those who participated in the program, and those who did not.  The results of the chi-square showed that there was no difference between the groups.  We failed to reject the null that there was a difference.

I worked together on part three with Tyler, Dana, and Jon Toy.  Although we worked together, Jon Toy by and large directed and guided the efforts of the group.

4. For this part of the homework, we had to test if there was a difference in the age distribution for male and female riders using the KS, Pearson's, Spearman's tests.  For this, Dana, Tyler, Jon and I worked together, but Jon directed most of the work (i.e. he let us struggle on our own, but almost always bailed us out with the right way to do things).  Celia Yu helped me with sort, and select random samples.
